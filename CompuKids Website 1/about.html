        <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
        <p>The Avengers are a team of superheroes from the Marvel Universe, brought together to face threats too big for any one hero to handle alone. Originally formed by characters like Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow, and Hawkeye, the group was created by Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. to protect Earth from global and cosmic dangers. Each member brings unique powers and strengths â€” from advanced technology and superhuman strength to elite combat skills and leadership.</p>
        <p>Over time, the team has evolved, with new heroes like Black Panther, Scarlet Witch, Spider-Man, and Doctor Strange joining the fight. Their most famous battles include facing Loki and the Chitauri, Ultron, and the universe-shaking threat of Thanos. Despite differences in personalities and backgrounds, what unites the Avengers is their commitment to justice, teamwork, and protecting the world at all costs.</p>
